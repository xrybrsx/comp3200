# Azure Text Analytics client library for Python

Text Analytics is a cloud-based service that provides advanced natural language processing over raw text, and includes the following main functions:

- Sentiment Analysis
- Named Entity Recognition
- Linked Entity Recognition
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Entity Recognition
- Language Detection
- Key Phrase Extraction
- Multiple Analysis
- Healthcare Entities Analysis

[Source code][source_code] | [Package (PyPI)][ta_pypi] | [API reference documentation][ta_ref_docs] | [Product documentation][ta_product_documentation] | [Samples][ta_samples]

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 2.7, or 3.5 or later is required to use this package.
- You must have an [Azure subscription][azure_subscription] and a
  [Cognitive Services or Text Analytics resource][ta_or_cs_resource] to use this package.

#### Create a Cognitive Services or Text Analytics resource

Text Analytics supports both [multi-service and single-service access][multi_and_single_service].
Create a Cognitive Services resource if you plan to access multiple cognitive services under a single endpoint/key. For Text Analytics access only, create a Text Analytics resource.

You can create the resource using

**Option 1:** [Azure Portal][azure_portal_create_ta_resource]

**Option 2:** [Azure CLI][azure_cli_create_ta_resource].
Below is an example of how you can create a Text Analytics resource using the CLI:

```bash
# Create a new resource group to hold the text analytics resource -
# if using an existing resource group, skip this step
az group create --name my-resource-group --location westus2
```

```bash
# Create text analytics
az cognitiveservices account create \
    --name text-analytics-resource \
    --resource-group my-resource-group \
    --kind TextAnalytics \
    --sku F0 \
    --location westus2 \
    --yes
```

Interaction with this service begins with an instance of a [client](#textanalyticsclient "TextAnalyticsClient").
To create a client object, you will need the cognitive services or text analytics `endpoint` to
your resource and a `credential` that allows you access:

```python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient

credential = AzureKeyCredential("<api_key>")
text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint="https://<region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/", credential=credential)
```

Note that if you create a [custom subdomain][cognitive_custom_subdomain]
name for your resource the endpoint may look different than in the above code snippet.
For example, `https://<my-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`.

### Install the package

Install the Azure Text Analytics client library for Python with [pip][pip]:

```bash
pip install azure-ai-textanalytics
```

> Note: This version of the client library defaults to the v3.1 version of the service

This table shows the relationship between SDK versions and supported API versions of the service

| SDK version  | Supported API version of service  |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| 5.1.0 - Latest GA release | 3.0, 3.1 (default) |
| 5.0.0  | 3.0 |


### Authenticate the client

#### Get the endpoint

You can find the endpoint for your text analytics resource using the
[Azure Portal][azure_portal_get_endpoint]
or [Azure CLI][azure_cli_endpoint_lookup]:

```bash
# Get the endpoint for the text analytics resource
az cognitiveservices account show --name "resource-name" --resource-group "resource-group-name" --query "properties.endpoint"
```

#### Get the API Key

You can get the [API key][cognitive_authentication_api_key] from the Cognitive Services or Text Analytics resource in the [Azure Portal][azure_portal_get_endpoint].
Alternatively, you can use [Azure CLI][azure_cli_endpoint_lookup] snippet below to get the API key of your resource.

`az cognitiveservices account keys list --name "resource-name" --resource-group "resource-group-name"`

#### Create a TextAnalyticsClient with an API Key Credential

Once you have the value for the API key, you can pass it as a string into an instance of [AzureKeyCredential][azure-key-credential]. Use the key as the credential parameter
to authenticate the client:

```python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient

credential = AzureKeyCredential("<api_key>")
text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint="https://<region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/", credential=credential)
```

#### Create a TextAnalyticsClient with an Azure Active Directory Credential

To use an [Azure Active Directory (AAD) token credential][cognitive_authentication_aad],
provide an instance of the desired credential type obtained from the
[azure-identity][azure_identity_credentials] library.
Note that regional endpoints do not support AAD authentication. Create a [custom subdomain][custom_subdomain]
name for your resource in order to use this type of authentication.

Authentication with AAD requires some initial setup:

- [Install azure-identity][install_azure_identity]
- [Register a new AAD application][register_aad_app]
- [Grant access][grant_role_access] to Text Analytics by assigning the `"Cognitive Services User"` role to your service principal.

After setup, you can choose which type of [credential][azure_identity_credentials] from azure.identity to use.
As an example, [DefaultAzureCredential][default_azure_credential]
can be used to authenticate the client:

Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the AAD application as environment variables:
AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET

Use the returned token credential to authenticate the client:

```python
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint="https://<my-custom-subdomain>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/", credential=credential)
```

## Key concepts

### TextAnalyticsClient

The Text Analytics client library provides a [TextAnalyticsClient][text_analytics_client] to do analysis on [batches of documents](#examples "Examples").
It provides both synchronous and asynchronous operations to access a specific use of Text Analytics, such as language detection or key phrase extraction.

### Input

A **document** is a single unit to be analyzed by the predictive models in the Text Analytics service.
The input for each operation is passed as a **list** of documents.

Each document can be passed as a string in the list, e.g.

```python
documents = ["I hated the movie. It was so slow!", "The movie made it into my top ten favorites. What a great movie!"]
```

or, if you wish to pass in a per-item document `id` or `language`/`country_hint`, they can be passed as a list of
[DetectLanguageInput][detect_language_input] or
[TextDocumentInput][text_document_input]
or a dict-like representation of the object:

```python
documents = [
    {"id": "1", "language": "en", "text": "I hated the movie. It was so slow!"},
    {"id": "2", "language": "en", "text": "The movie made it into my top ten favorites. What a great movie!"},
]
```

See [service limitations][service_limits] for the input, including document length limits, maximum batch size, and supported text encoding.

### Return Value

The return value for a single document can be a result or error object.
A heterogeneous list containing a collection of result and error objects is returned from each operation.
These results/errors are index-matched with the order of the provided documents.

A **result**, such as [AnalyzeSentimentResult][analyze_sentiment_result],
is the result of a Text Analytics operation and contains a prediction or predictions about a document input.

The **error** object, [DocumentError][document_error], indicates that the service had trouble processing the document and contains
the reason it was unsuccessful.

### Document Error Handling

You can filter for a result or error object in the list by using the `is_error` attribute. For a result object this is always `False` and for a
[DocumentError][document_error] this is `True`.

For example, to filter out all DocumentErrors you might use list comprehension:

```python
response = text_analytics_client.analyze_sentiment(documents)
successful_responses = [doc for doc in response if not doc.is_error]
```

### Long-Running Operations

Long-running operations are operations which consist of an initial request sent to the service to start an operation,
followed by polling the service at intervals to determine whether the operation has completed or failed, and if it has
succeeded, to get the result.

Methods that support healthcare analysis or multiple analyses are modeled as long-running operations.
The client exposes a `begin_<method-name>` method that returns a poller object. Callers should wait
for the operation to complete by calling `result()` on the poller object returned from the `begin_<method-name>` method.
Sample code snippets are provided to illustrate using long-running operations [below](#examples "Examples").

## Examples

The following section provides several code snippets covering some of the most common Text Analytics tasks, including:

- [Analyze Sentiment](#analyze-sentiment "Analyze sentiment")
- [Recognize Entities](#recognize-entities "Recognize entities")
- [Recognize Linked Entities](#recognize-linked-entities "Recognize linked entities")
- [Recognize PII Entities](#recognize-pii-entities "Recognize pii entities")
- [Extract Key Phrases](#extract-key-phrases "Extract key phrases")
- [Detect Language](#detect-language "Detect language")
- [Healthcare Entities Analysis](#healthcare-entities-analysis "Healthcare Entities Analysis")
- [Multiple Analysis](#multiple-analysis "Multiple analysis")

### Analyze sentiment

[analyze_sentiment][analyze_sentiment] looks at its input text and determines whether its sentiment is positive, negative, neutral or mixed. It's response includes per-sentence sentiment analysis and confidence scores.

```python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient

credential = AzureKeyCredential("<api_key>")
endpoint="https://<region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/"

text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint, credential)

documents = [
    "I did not like the restaurant. The food was somehow both too spicy and underseasoned. Additionally, I thought the location was too far away from the playhouse.",
    "The restaurant was decorated beautifully. The atmosphere was unlike any other restaurant I've been to.",
    "The food was yummy. :)"
]

response = text_analytics_client.analyze_sentiment(documents, language="en")
result = [doc for doc in response if not doc.is_error]

for doc in result:
    print("Overall sentiment: {}".format(doc.sentiment))
    print("Scores: positive={}; neutral={}; negative={} \n".format(
        doc.confidence_scores.positive,
        doc.confidence_scores.neutral,
        doc.confidence_scores.negative,
    ))
```

The returned response is a heterogeneous list of result and error objects: list[[AnalyzeSentimentResult][analyze_sentiment_result], [DocumentError][document_error]]

Please refer to the service documentation for a conceptual discussion of [sentiment analysis][sentiment_analysis]. To see how to conduct more granular analysis into the opinions related to individual aspects (such as attributes of a product or service) in a text, see [here][opinion_mining_sample].

### Recognize entities

[recognize_entities][recognize_entities] recognizes and categories entities in its input text as people, places, organizations, date/time, quantities, percentages, currencies, and more.

```python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient

credential = AzureKeyCredential("<api_key>")
endpoint="https://<region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/"

text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint, credential)

documents = [
    """
    Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Its headquarters are located in Redmond. Redmond is a
    city in King County, Washington, United States, located 15 miles east of Seattle.
    """,
    "Jeff bought three dozen eggs because there was a 50% discount."
]

response = text_analytics_client.recognize_entities(documents, language="en")
result = [doc for doc in response if not doc.is_error]

for doc in result:
    for entity in doc.entities:
        print("Entity: {}".format(entity.text))
        print("...Category: {}".format(entity.category))
        print("...Confidence Score: {}".format(entity.confidence_score))
        print("...Offset: {}".format(entity.offset))
```

The returned response is a heterogeneous list of result and error objects: list[[RecognizeEntitiesResult][recognize_entities_result], [DocumentError][document_error]]

Please refer to the service documentation for a conceptual discussion of [named entity recognition][named_entity_recognition]
and [supported types][named_entity_categories].

### Recognize linked entities

[recognize_linked_entities][recognize_linked_entities] recognizes and disambiguates the identity of each entity found in its input text (for example,
determining whether an occurrence of the word Mars refers to the planet, or to the
Roman god of war). Recognized entities are associated with URLs to a well-known knowledge base, like Wikipedia.

```python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient

credential = AzureKeyCredential("<api_key>")
endpoint="https://<region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/"

text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint, credential)

documents = [
    "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Its headquarters are located in Redmond.",
    "Easter Island, a Chilean territory, is a remote volcanic island in Polynesia."
]

response = text_analytics_client.recognize_linked_entities(documents, language="en")
result = [doc for doc in response if not doc.is_error]

for doc in result:
    for entity in doc.entities:
        print("Entity: {}".format(entity.name))
        print("...URL: {}".format(entity.url))
        print("...Data Source: {}".format(entity.data_source))
        print("...Entity matches:")
        for match in entity.matches:
            print("......Entity match text: {}".format(match.text))
            print("......Confidence Score: {}".format(match.confidence_score))
            print("......Offset: {}".format(match.offset))
```

The returned response is a heterogeneous list of result and error objects: list[[RecognizeLinkedEntitiesResult][recognize_linked_entities_result], [DocumentError][document_error]]

Please refer to the service documentation for a conceptual discussion of [entity linking][linked_entity_recognition]
and [supported types][linked_entities_categories].

### Recognize PII entities

[recognize_pii_entities][recognize_pii_entities] recognizes and categorizes Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entities in its input text, such as
Social Security Numbers, bank account information, credit card numbers, and more.

```python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient

credential = AzureKeyCredential("<api_key>")
endpoint="https://<region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/"

text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint, credential)

documents = [
    """
    We have an employee called Parker who cleans up after customers. The employee's
    SSN is 859-98-0987, and their phone number is 555-555-5555.
    """
]
response = text_analytics_client.recognize_pii_entities(documents, language="en")
result = [doc for doc in response if not doc.is_error]
for idx, doc in enumerate(result):
    print("Document text: {}".format(documents[idx]))
    print("Redacted document text: {}".format(doc.redacted_text))
    for entity in doc.entities:
        print("...Entity: {}".format(entity.text))
        print("......Category: {}".format(entity.category))
        print("......Confidence Score: {}".format(entity.confidence_score))
        print("......Offset: {}".format(entity.offset))
```

The returned response is a heterogeneous list of result and error objects: list[[RecognizePiiEntitiesResult][recognize_pii_entities_result], [DocumentError][document_error]]

Please refer to the service documentation for [supported PII entity types][pii_entity_categories].

Note: The Recognize PII Entities service is available only in the v3.1 API version.

### Extract key phrases

[extract_key_phrases][extract_key_phrases] determines the main talking points in its input text. For example, for the input text "The food was delicious and there were wonderful staff", the API returns: "food" and "wonderful staff".

```python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient

credential = AzureKeyCredential("<api_key>")
endpoint="https://<region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/"

text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint, credential)

documents = [
    "Redmond is a city in King County, Washington, United States, located 15 miles east of Seattle.",
    """
    I need to take my cat to the veterinarian. He has been sick recently, and I need to take him
    before I travel to South America for the summer.
    """,
]

response = text_analytics_client.extract_key_phrases(documents, language="en")
result = [doc for doc in response if not doc.is_error]

for doc in result:
    print(doc.key_phrases)
```

The returned response is a heterogeneous list of result and error objects: list[[ExtractKeyPhrasesResult][extract_key_phrases_result], [DocumentError][document_error]]

Please refer to the service documentation for a conceptual discussion of [key phrase extraction][key_phrase_extraction].

### Detect language

[detect_language][detect_language] determines the language of its input text, including the confidence score of the predicted language.

```python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient

credential = AzureKeyCredential("<api_key>")
endpoint="https://<region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/"

text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint, credential)

documents = [
    """
    This whole document is written in English. In order for the whole document to be written
    in English, every sentence also has to be written in English, which it is.
    """,
    "Il documento scritto in italiano.",
    "Dies ist in deutsche Sprache verfasst."
]

response = text_analytics_client.detect_language(documents)
result = [doc for doc in response if not doc.is_error]

for doc in result:
    print("Language detected: {}".format(doc.primary_language.name))
    print("ISO6391 name: {}".format(doc.primary_language.iso6391_name))
    print("Confidence score: {}\n".format(doc.primary_language.confidence_score))
```

The returned response is a heterogeneous list of result and error objects: list[[DetectLanguageResult][detect_language_result], [DocumentError][document_error]]

Please refer to the service documentation for a conceptual discussion of [language detection][language_detection]
and [language and regional support][language_and_regional_support].

### Healthcare Entities Analysis

[Long-running operation](#long-running-operations) [begin_analyze_healthcare_entities][analyze_healthcare_entities] extracts entities recognized within the healthcare domain, and identifies relationships between entities within the input document and links to known sources of information in various well known databases, such as UMLS, CHV, MSH, etc.

```python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient

credential = AzureKeyCredential("<api_key>")
endpoint="https://<region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/"

text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint, credential)

documents = ["Subject is taking 100mg of ibuprofen twice daily"]

poller = text_analytics_client.begin_analyze_healthcare_entities(documents)
result = poller.result()

docs = [doc for doc in result if not doc.is_error]

print("Results of Healthcare Entities Analysis:")
for idx, doc in enumerate(docs):
    for entity in doc.entities:
        print("Entity: {}".format(entity.text))
        print("...Normalized Text: {}".format(entity.normalized_text))
        print("...Category: {}".format(entity.category))
        print("...Subcategory: {}".format(entity.subcategory))
        print("...Offset: {}".format(entity.offset))
        print("...Confidence score: {}".format(entity.confidence_score))
        if entity.data_sources is not None:
            print("...Data Sources:")
            for data_source in entity.data_sources:
                print("......Entity ID: {}".format(data_source.entity_id))
                print("......Name: {}".format(data_source.name))
        if entity.assertion is not None:
            print("...Assertion:")
            print("......Conditionality: {}".format(entity.assertion.conditionality))
            print("......Certainty: {}".format(entity.assertion.certainty))
            print("......Association: {}".format(entity.assertion.association))
    for relation in doc.entity_relations:
        print("Relation of type: {} has the following roles".format(relation.relation_type))
        for role in relation.roles:
            print("...Role '{}' with entity '{}'".format(role.name, role.entity.text))
    print("------------------------------------------")
```

Note: The Healthcare Entities Analysis service is available only in the v3.1 API version.

### Multiple Analysis

[Long-running operation](#long-running-operations) [begin_analyze_actions][analyze_actions] performs multiple analyses over one set of documents in a single request. Currently it is supported using any combination of the following Text Analytics APIs in a single request:

- Entities Recognition
- PII Entities Recognition
- Linked Entity Recognition
- Key Phrase Extraction
- Sentiment Analysis

```python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import (
    TextAnalyticsClient,
    RecognizeEntitiesAction,
    AnalyzeSentimentAction,
)

credential = AzureKeyCredential("<api_key>")
endpoint="https://<region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/"

text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint, credential)

documents = ["Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen."]

poller = text_analytics_client.begin_analyze_actions(
    documents,
    display_name="Sample Text Analysis",
    actions=[
        RecognizeEntitiesAction(),
        AnalyzeSentimentAction()
    ]
)

# returns multiple actions results in the same order as the inputted actions
document_results = poller.result()
for doc, action_results in zip(documents, document_results):
    recognize_entities_result, analyze_sentiment_result = action_results
    print("\nDocument text: {}".format(doc))
    print("...Results of Recognize Entities Action:")
    if recognize_entities_result.is_error:
        print("......Is an error with code '{}' and message '{}'".format(
            recognize_entities_result.code, recognize_entities_result.message
        ))
    else:
        for entity in recognize_entities_result.entities:
            print("......Entity: {}".format(entity.text))
            print(".........Category: {}".format(entity.category))
            print(".........Confidence Score: {}".format(entity.confidence_score))
            print(".........Offset: {}".format(entity.offset))

    print("...Results of Analyze Sentiment action:")
    if analyze_sentiment_result.is_error:
        print("......Is an error with code '{}' and message '{}'".format(
            analyze_sentiment_result.code, analyze_sentiment_result.message
        ))
    else:
        print("......Overall sentiment: {}".format(analyze_sentiment_result.sentiment))
        print("......Scores: positive={}; neutral={}; negative={} \n".format(
            analyze_sentiment_result.confidence_scores.positive,
            analyze_sentiment_result.confidence_scores.neutral,
            analyze_sentiment_result.confidence_scores.negative,
        ))
    print("------------------------------------------")
```

The returned response is an object encapsulating multiple iterables, each representing results of individual analyses.

Note: Multiple analysis is available only in the v3.1 API version.

## Optional Configuration

Optional keyword arguments can be passed in at the client and per-operation level.
The azure-core [reference documentation][azure_core_ref_docs]
describes available configurations for retries, logging, transport protocols, and more.

## Troubleshooting

### General

The Text Analytics client will raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core][azure_core].

### Logging

This library uses the standard
[logging][python_logging] library for logging.
Basic information about HTTP sessions (URLs, headers, etc.) is logged at INFO
level.

Detailed DEBUG level logging, including request/response bodies and unredacted
headers, can be enabled on a client with the `logging_enable` keyword argument:

```python
import sys
import logging
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient

# Create a logger for the 'azure' SDK
logger = logging.getLogger('azure')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Configure a console output
handler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)
logger.addHandler(handler)

endpoint = "https://<my-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# This client will log detailed information about its HTTP sessions, at DEBUG level
text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint, credential, logging_enable=True)
result = text_analytics_client.analyze_sentiment(["I did not like the restaurant. The food was too spicy."])
```

Similarly, `logging_enable` can enable detailed logging for a single operation,
even when it isn't enabled for the client:

```python
result = text_analytics_client.analyze_sentiment(documents, logging_enable=True)
```

# Release History

## 5.1.0 (2021-07-07)

This version of the SDK defaults to the latest supported API version, which currently is `v3.1`.
Includes all changes from `5.1.0b1` to `5.1.0b7`.

Note: this version will be the last to officially support Python 3.5, future versions will require Python 2.7 or Python 3.6+.

### Features Added

- Added `catagories_filter` to `RecognizePiiEntitiesAction`
- Added `HealthcareEntityCategory`
- Added AAD support for the `begin_analyze_healthcare_entities` methods.

### Breaking Changes

- Changed: the response structure of `being_analyze_actions`. Now, we return a list of results, where each result is a list of the action results for the document, in the order the documents and actions were passed.
- Changed: `begin_analyze_actions` now accepts a single action per type. A `ValueError` is raised if duplicate actions are passed.
- Removed: `AnalyzeActionsType`
- Removed: `AnalyzeActionsResult`
- Removed: `AnalyzeActionsError`
- Removed: `HealthcareEntityRelationRoleType`
- Changed: renamed `HealthcareEntityRelationType` to `HealthcareEntityRelation`
- Changed: renamed `PiiEntityCategoryType` to `PiiEntityCategory`
- Changed: renamed `PiiEntityDomainType` to `PiiEntityDomain`

## 5.1.0b7 (2021-05-18)

**Breaking Changes**
- Renamed `begin_analyze_batch_actions` to `begin_analyze_actions`.
- Renamed `AnalyzeBatchActionsType` to `AnalyzeActionsType`.
- Renamed `AnalyzeBatchActionsResult` to `AnalyzeActionsResult`.
- Renamed `AnalyzeBatchActionsError` to `AnalyzeActionsError`.
- Renamed `AnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesResultItem` to `AnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesResult`.
- Fixed `AnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesResult`'s `statistics` to be the correct type, `TextDocumentStatistics`
- Remove `RequestStatistics`, use `TextDocumentBatchStatistics` instead

**New Features**
- Added enums `EntityConditionality`, `EntityCertainty`, and `EntityAssociation`.
- Added `AnalyzeSentimentAction` as a supported action type for `begin_analyze_batch_actions`.
- Added kwarg `disable_service_logs`. If set to true, you opt-out of having your text input logged on the service side for troubleshooting.

## 5.1.0b6 (2021-03-09)

**Breaking Changes**
- By default, we now target the service's `v3.1-preview.4` endpoint through enum value `TextAnalyticsApiVersion.V3_1_PREVIEW`
- Removed property `related_entities` on `HealthcareEntity` and added `entity_relations` onto the document response level for healthcare
- Renamed properties `aspect` and `opinions` to `target` and `assessments` respectively in class `MinedOpinion`.
- Renamed classes `AspectSentiment` and `OpinionSentiment` to `TargetSentiment` and `AssessmentSentiment` respectively.

**New Features**
- Added `RecognizeLinkedEntitiesAction` as a supported action type for `begin_analyze_batch_actions`.
- Added parameter `categories_filter` to the `recognize_pii_entities` client method.
- Added enum `PiiEntityCategoryType`.
- Add property `normalized_text` to `HealthcareEntity`. This property is a normalized version of the `text` property that already
exists on the `HealthcareEntity`
- Add property `assertion` onto `HealthcareEntity`. This contains assertions about the entity itself, i.e. if the entity represents a diagnosis,
is this diagnosis conditional on a symptom?

**Known Issues**

- `begin_analyze_healthcare_entities` is currently in gated preview and can not be used with AAD credentials. For more information, see [the Text Analytics for Health documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-for-health?tabs=ner#request-access-to-the-public-preview).
- At time of this SDK release, the service is not respecting the value passed through `model_version` to `begin_analyze_healthcare_entities`, it only uses the latest model.

## 5.1.0b5 (2021-02-10)

**Breaking Changes**

- Rename `begin_analyze` to `begin_analyze_batch_actions`.
- Now instead of separate parameters for all of the different types of actions you can pass to `begin_analyze_batch_actions`, we accept one parameter `actions`,
which is a list of actions you would like performed. The results of the actions are returned in the same order as when inputted.
- The response object from `begin_analyze_batch_actions` has also changed. Now, after the completion of your long running operation, we return a paged iterable
of action results, in the same order they've been inputted. The actual document results for each action are included under property `document_results` of
each action result.

**New Features**
- Renamed `begin_analyze_healthcare` to `begin_analyze_healthcare_entities`.
- Renamed `AnalyzeHealthcareResult` to `AnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesResult` and `AnalyzeHealthcareResultItem` to `AnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesResultItem`.
- Renamed `HealthcareEntityLink` to `HealthcareEntityDataSource` and renamed its properties `id` to `entity_id` and `data_source` to `name`.
- Removed `relations` from `AnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesResultItem` and added `related_entities` to `HealthcareEntity`.
- Moved the cancellation logic for the Analyze Healthcare Entities service from
the service client to the poller object returned from `begin_analyze_healthcare_entities`.
- Exposed Analyze Healthcare Entities operation metadata on the poller object returned from `begin_analyze_healthcare_entities`.
- No longer need to specify `api_version=TextAnalyticsApiVersion.V3_1_PREVIEW_3` when calling `begin_analyze` and `begin_analyze_healthcare_entities`. `begin_analyze_healthcare_entities` is still in gated preview though.
- Added a new parameter `string_index_type` to the service client methods `begin_analyze_healthcare_entities`, `analyze_sentiment`, `recognize_entities`, `recognize_pii_entities`, and `recognize_linked_entities` which tells the service how to interpret string offsets.
- Added property `length` to `CategorizedEntity`, `SentenceSentiment`, `LinkedEntityMatch`, `AspectSentiment`, `OpinionSentiment`, `PiiEntity` and
`HealthcareEntity`.

## 5.1.0b4 (2021-01-12)

**Bug Fixes**

- Package requires [azure-core](https://pypi.org/project/azure-core/) version 1.8.2 or greater


## 5.1.0b3 (2020-11-19)

**New Features**
- We have added method `begin_analyze`, which supports long-running batch process of Named Entity Recognition, Personally identifiable Information, and Key Phrase Extraction. To use, you must specify `api_version=TextAnalyticsApiVersion.V3_1_PREVIEW_3` when creating your client.
- We have added method `begin_analyze_healthcare`, which supports the service's Health API. Since the Health API is currently only available in a gated preview, you need to have your subscription on the service's allow list, and you must specify `api_version=TextAnalyticsApiVersion.V3_1_PREVIEW_3` when creating your client. Note that since this is a gated preview, AAD is not supported. More information [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-for-health?tabs=ner#request-access-to-the-public-preview).


## 5.1.0b2 (2020-10-06)

**Breaking changes**
- Removed property `length` from `CategorizedEntity`, `SentenceSentiment`, `LinkedEntityMatch`, `AspectSentiment`, `OpinionSentiment`, and `PiiEntity`.
To get the length of the text in these models, just call `len()` on the `text` property.
- When a parameter or endpoint is not compatible with the API version you specify, we will now return a `ValueError` instead of a `NotImplementedError`.
- Client side validation of input is now disabled by default. This means there will be no `ValidationError`s thrown by the client SDK in the case of malformed input. The error will now be thrown by the service through an `HttpResponseError`.

## 5.1.0b1 (2020-09-17)

**New features**
- We are now targeting the service's v3.1-preview API as the default. If you would like to still use version v3.0 of the service,
pass in `v3.0` to the kwarg `api_version` when creating your TextAnalyticsClient
- We have added an API `recognize_pii_entities` which returns entities containing personally identifiable information for a batch of documents. Only available for API version v3.1-preview and up.
- Added `offset` and `length` properties for `CategorizedEntity`, `SentenceSentiment`, and `LinkedEntityMatch`. These properties are only available for API versions v3.1-preview and up.
  - `length` is the number of characters in the text of these models
  - `offset` is the offset of the text from the start of the document
- We now have added support for opinion mining. To use this feature, you need to make sure you are using the service's
v3.1-preview API. To get this support pass `show_opinion_mining` as True when calling the `analyze_sentiment` endpoint
- Add property `bing_entity_search_api_id` to the `LinkedEntity` class. This property is only available for v3.1-preview and up, and it is to be
used in conjunction with the Bing Entity Search API to fetch additional relevant information about the returned entity.

## 5.0.0 (2020-07-27)

- Re-release of GA version 1.0.0 with an updated version

- The keyword argument `response_hook` has been renamed to `raw_response_hook`
- `length` and `offset` attributes have been renamed to `grapheme_length` and `grapheme_offset` for the `SentenceSentiment`,
`CategorizedEntity`, `PiiEntity`, and `LinkedEntityMatch` models

**New features**
- Pass `country_hint="none"` to not use the default country hint of `"US"`.

**Dependency updates**
- Adopted [azure-core](https://pypi.org/project/azure-core/) version 1.3.0 or greater

## 1.0.0b2 (2020-02-11)

**Breaking changes**

- The single text, module-level operations `single_detect_language()`, `single_recognize_entities()`, `single_extract_key_phrases()`, `single_analyze_sentiment()`, `single_recognize_pii_entities()`, and `single_recognize_linked_entities()`
have been removed from the client library. Use the batching methods for optimal performance in production environments.
- To use an API key as the credential for authenticating the client, a new credential class `TextAnalyticsApiKeyCredential("<api_key>")` must be passed in for the `credential` parameter.
Passing the API key as a string is no longer supported.
- `detect_languages()` is renamed to `detect_language()`.
- The `TextAnalyticsError` model has been simplified to an object with only attributes `code`, `message`, and `target`.

**Fixes and improvements**

- `__repr__` has been added to all of the response objects.
- If you try to access a result attribute on a `DocumentError` object, an `AttributeError` is raised with a custom error message that provides the document ID and error of the invalid document.


## 1.0.0b1 (2020-01-09)

Version (1.0.0b1) is the first preview of our efforts to create a user-friendly and Pythonic client library for Azure Text Analytics. For more information about this, and preview releases of other Azure SDK libraries, please visit
https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/python.html.

**Breaking changes: New API design**

- New namespace/package name:
  - The namespace/package name for Azure Text Analytics client library has changed from `azure.cognitiveservices.language.textanalytics` to `azure.ai.textanalytics`

- New operations and naming:
  - `detect_language` is renamed to `detect_languages`
  - `entities` is renamed to `recognize_entities`
  - `key_phrases` is renamed to `extract_key_phrases`
  - `sentiment` is renamed to `analyze_sentiment`
  - New operation `recognize_pii_entities` finds personally identifiable information entities in text
  - New operation `recognize_linked_entities` provides links from a well-known knowledge base for each recognized entity
  - New module-level operations `single_detect_language`, `single_recognize_entities`, `single_extract_key_phrases`, `single_analyze_sentiment`, `single_recognize_pii_entities`, and `single_recognize_linked_entities` perform
  function on a single string instead of a batch of text documents and can be imported from the `azure.ai.textanalytics` namespace.
  - New client and module-level async APIs added to subnamespace `azure.ai.textanalytics.aio`.
  - `MultiLanguageInput` has been renamed to `TextDocumentInput`
  - `LanguageInput` has been renamed to `DetectLanguageInput`
  - `DocumentLanguage` has been renamed to `DetectLanguageResult`
  - `DocumentEntities` has been renamed to `RecognizeEntitiesResult`
  - `DocumentLinkedEntities` has been renamed to `RecognizeLinkedEntitiesResult`
  - `DocumentKeyPhrases` has been renamed to `ExtractKeyPhrasesResult`
  - `DocumentSentiment` has been renamed to `AnalyzeSentimentResult`
  - `DocumentStatistics` has been renamed to `TextDocumentStatistics`
  - `RequestStatistics` has been renamed to `TextDocumentBatchStatistics`
  - `Entity` has been renamed to `NamedEntity`
  - `Match` has been renamed to `LinkedEntityMatch`
  - The batching methods' `documents` parameter has been renamed `inputs`

- New input types:
  - `detect_languages` can take as input a `list[DetectLanguageInput]` or a `list[str]`. A list of dict-like objects in the same shape as `DetectLanguageInput` is still accepted as input.
  - `recognize_entities`, `recognize_pii_entities`, `recognize_linked_entities`, `extract_key_phrases`, `analyze_sentiment` can take as input a `list[TextDocumentInput]` or `list[str]`.
  A list of dict-like objects in the same shape as `TextDocumentInput` is still accepted as input.

- New parameters/keyword arguments:
  - All operations now take a keyword argument `model_version` which allows the user to specify a string referencing the desired model version to be used for analysis. If no string specified, it will default to the latest, non-preview version.
  - `detect_languages` now takes a parameter `country_hint` which allows you to specify the country hint for the entire batch. Any per-item country hints will take precedence over a whole batch hint.
  - `recognize_entities`, `recognize_pii_entities`, `recognize_linked_entities`, `extract_key_phrases`, `analyze_sentiment` now take a parameter `language` which allows you to specify the language for the entire batch.
  Any per-item specified language will take precedence over a whole batch hint.
  - A `default_country_hint` or `default_language` keyword argument can be passed at client instantiation to set the default values for all operations.
  - A `response_hook` keyword argument can be passed with a callback to use the raw response from the service. Additionally, values returned for `TextDocumentBatchStatistics` and `model_version` used must be retrieved using a response hook.
  - `show_stats` and `model_version` parameters move to keyword only arguments.

- New return types
  - The return types for the batching methods (`detect_languages`, `recognize_entities`, `recognize_pii_entities`, `recognize_linked_entities`, `extract_key_phrases`, `analyze_sentiment`) now return a heterogeneous list of
  result objects and document errors in the order passed in with the request. To iterate over the list and filter for result or error, a boolean property on each object called `is_error` can be used to determine whether the returned response object at
  that index is a result or an error:
  - `detect_languages` now returns a List[Union[`DetectLanguageResult`, `DocumentError`]]
  - `recognize_entities` now returns a List[Union[`RecognizeEntitiesResult`, `DocumentError`]]
  - `recognize_pii_entities` now returns a List[Union[`RecognizePiiEntitiesResult`, `DocumentError`]]
  - `recognize_linked_entities` now returns a List[Union[`RecognizeLinkedEntitiesResult`, `DocumentError`]]
  - `extract_key_phrases` now returns a List[Union[`ExtractKeyPhrasesResult`, `DocumentError`]]
  - `analyze_sentiment` now returns a List[Union[`AnalyzeSentimentResult`, `DocumentError`]]
  - The module-level, single text operations will return a single result object or raise the error found on the document:
  - `single_detect_languages` returns a `DetectLanguageResult`
  - `single_recognize_entities` returns a `RecognizeEntitiesResult`
  - `single_recognize_pii_entities` returns a `RecognizePiiEntitiesResult`
  - `single_recognize_linked_entities` returns a `RecognizeLinkedEntitiesResult`
  - `single_extract_key_phrases` returns a `ExtractKeyPhrasesResult`
  - `single_analyze_sentiment` returns a `AnalyzeSentimentResult`

- New underlying REST pipeline implementation, based on the new `azure-core` library.
- Client and pipeline configuration is now available via keyword arguments at both the client level, and per-operation. See README for a full list of optional configuration arguments.
- Authentication using `azure-identity` credentials
  - see the
  [Azure Identity documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity/README.md)
  for more information
- New error hierarchy:
    - All service errors will now use the base type: `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError`
    - There is one exception type derived from this base type for authentication errors:

## 0.2.0 (2019-03-12)

**Features**

- Client class can be used as a context manager to keep the underlying HTTP session open for performance
- New method "entities"
- Model KeyPhraseBatchResultItem has a new parameter statistics
- Model KeyPhraseBatchResult has a new parameter statistics
- Model LanguageBatchResult has a new parameter statistics
- Model LanguageBatchResultItem has a new parameter statistics
- Model SentimentBatchResult has a new parameter statistics

**Breaking changes**

- TextAnalyticsAPI main client has been renamed TextAnalyticsClient
- TextAnalyticsClient parameter is no longer a region but a complete endpoint

**General Breaking changes**

This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might* introduce breaking changes.

- Model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. All positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments.
  To keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 uses the "*" syntax for keyword-only arguments.
- Enum types now use the "str" mixin (class AzureEnum(str, Enum)) to improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.
  While this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important, and are documented here:
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others
  At a glance:

  - "is" should not be used at all.
  - "format" will return the string value, where "%s" string formatting will return `NameOfEnum.stringvalue`. Format syntax should be prefered.

**Bugfixes**

- Compatibility of the sdist with wheel 0.31.0
